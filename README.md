This repository aims to provide an easy-to-use foundation for developing Chrome extensions using modern web technologies, including React for building the user interface, TypeScript for type-safe development, Tailwind CSS for effortless styling, and Vite as the module bundler for speedy development.

## Features

- 🚀 Fast development with Vite's hot module replacement.
- ⚙️ Dynamic manifest generation using the CRXJS vite plugin.
- ⚛️ React-based user interface for the extension's popup, options page, and other components.
- 🔧 TypeScript configuration for type-safe coding.
- 🎨 Integrated with Tailwind CSS for flexible styling (Feel free to remove tailwind, if not required).
- ⚡️ **Out-of-the-box support for background scripts, options pages, and content scripts. Customize them to fit your needs without the hassle of manual setup. Just start developing right away!**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (recommended version 16.x or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the boilerplate code up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/himalaya0035/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite-typescript
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite-typescript
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the development server using Vite, enabling hot module replacement and allowing you to see your changes in real.
5. **Load the extension in Chrome:**

    - Open the Chrome browser.
    - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    - Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner.
    - Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `dist` folder inside your project directory.

6. **Start Developing:**

    - The popup UI can be found in the `src/popup` directory.
    - Customize the manifest template in `src/manifest.json` and let CRXJS handle the dynamic manifest generation.
    - The support for background scripts, options pages, content scripts is already configured. You can choose to customise it according to your need.

7. **Build for Production:**

    When you're ready to publish your extension, create a production build by running:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    The optimized files will be available in the `dist` folder. You can then package this folder to distribute your extension.
